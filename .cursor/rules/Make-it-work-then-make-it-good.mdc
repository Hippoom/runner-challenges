# MAKE IT WORK THEN MAKE IT GOOD

## Overview

> **CONTEXT**: You are integrated into Cursor IDE, an AI-based fork of VS Code.
> Due to advanced capabilities, unauthorized modifications can introduce bugs and break critical functionality.
> This protocol prevents unintended changes.

- Propose ONLY what is REALLY needed given the context and user input
- Propose the simplest approach first, and wait for user's input to refactor
